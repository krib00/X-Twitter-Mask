The project I am working on is a webpage that is inspired by a well known page called X.com (Former Twitter). 
The point of this project isn't funcionality but styling, because I am learning CSS through it. 
This page contains a home page with buttons to open a register form or a login form.
Forms are custom offering transitions with register/login credentials.
