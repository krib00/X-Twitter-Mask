The project I am working on is a webpage that is inspired by a well known page called X.com (Former Twitter). 

The main point of this project isn't funcionality but styling, because I am learning CSS through it. 

This page contains a home page with buttons to open a register form or a login form.

Forms are custom offering transitions with register/login credentials.

Site is labelled as a "Dangerous site", due to similarity of original one.

To avoid this message click on "Details" and then on "This unsafe site".
