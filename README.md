The project I am working on is a webpage that is inspired by a well known page called X.com (Former Twitter). 

The main point of this project isn't funcionality but styling, because I am learning CSS through it. 

This page contains a home page with buttons to open a register form or a login form.

Forms are custom offering transitions with register/login credentials.

Site is labelled as "dangerous site" on google chrome or firefox due to similarity of original website (Twitter). 

To avoid the message you can open it on other browsers (ex. Edge, Brave..), or you can click on "details and then "this unsafe site".
